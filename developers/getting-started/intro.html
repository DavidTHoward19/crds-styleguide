      <h1 class="page-header">What is the DDK?</h1>
      <p class="lead">The Digital Design Kit, aka DDK, is a website that provides guidance and usage details for implementing various patterns and styles, geared to towards the organization’s designers &amp; developers.</p>

      <p>You can think of the DDK as a glorified reference document. Whenever you’re looking for the official rules around a UI element or need to know the proper approach for placing icons in pages or are curious if a UX pattern to resolve some issue has already been adopted by the organization, the DDK is the place to look first.</p>

      <h2 class="component-header">What is crds-styles?</h2>

      <p>The shared, global style package that powers Crossroads’ digital properties, a.k.a. <code>crds-styles</code>, is <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/crds-styles">a separate NPM package</a> that should be installed in your application as a dependency.</p>

      <p>Overtime, the DDK will grow and mature, as will the shared package that powers it.  Be sure to <a href="https://github.com/crdschurch/crds-styles#versions--roadmap">review the semantic versioning rules and project roadmap</a> to protect yourself from accidental regressions as the package changes over time.</p>
