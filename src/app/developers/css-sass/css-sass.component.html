	<p>In effort to maintain a consistent codebase, we’ve implemented <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint">stylelint</a> in crds-styles to help enforce some general rules to follow when formatting new style declarations. While you can expect these rules to change over time, the basic ruleset can be <a href="https://github.com/crdschurch/crds-styles/blob/development/.stylelintrc">viewed here</a>.</p>

	<p>To manually execute the linter against the crds-styles project, simply execute the following command…</p>

	<p><code>$ npm run lint</code></p>

	<p>Currently, linter rules are not enforced during the build process but it’s a good idea to observe their feedback regularly and correct any violations as you encounter them. If you’re using VSCode, you can install the <a href="https://github.com/shinnn/vscode-stylelint">vscode-stylelint plugin</a> for real-time feedback.</p>
