	<h3>Built on Bootstrap</h3>
</div>

<p>Twitter Bootstrap is the most popular, open-source front-end framework for developing responsive, mobile-first projects on the web.</p>

<p>Used across the internet to power some of the world’s most compelling websites, Bootstrap provides the stable, battle-tested foundation on which <code>crds-styles</code> is built. Because it inherits directly from Bootstrap, all of the conventions and components provided by that framework are available when adding <code>crds-styles</code> to your project.</p>

	<h3>Bootstrap Components for NG1.5 v. NG2</h3>
</div>

<p>Out of the box, Bootstrap provides a handful of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/">jQuery plugins</a> which provide some interactivity for many of the components built into the framework. Since jQuery isn’t often available within Angular applications (<a href="http://tech.zumba.com/2014/08/02/angularjs-forget-jquery/">why?</a>) we rely on 3rd-party packages to provide the same or similar functionality within our applications.</p>

<p>For projects running versions of Angular greater than 2.0, we recommend <a href="https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap">NGX-Bootstrap</a>. For earlier versions of Angular, checkout <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/">Angular-UI</a>.</p>

<p>While you may see an example of a component rendered within the DDK, it is generally best to refer to the official documentation for that component as things can change dramatically from version to version.</p>
