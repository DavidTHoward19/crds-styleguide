  <h2>Typesetting</h2>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p>In order to acheive a balance of both readability &amp; relative scale across the entire codebase, we've selected a base-font size of <code>16px</code> since that is the number most commonly associated with modern browser defaults, e.g. <code>16px = 1em</code>. Accordingly, this value has been used to override Bootstrap's <code>$font-size-base</code> variable.</p>

  <h3>Body Content</h3>
</div>

<div class="selector">
  <p>To provide the best possible reading experience for any content-heavy pages, we recommend rendering most copy with a font-size of <code>19px</code>. To ensure any copy (whether encapsulated with <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> or not) is rendered at this size, simply wrap the main content area of your page with <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> or apply <code>.main</code> to the parent element.</p>

  <div class="crds-example">
<main>
  <p>Build relationships with the homeless in our city by hanging out at The Outlet at City Gospel Mission, a place where they can recharge and connect with people who care about them by providing positive interpersonal relationships.</p>
</main>

<div class="main">
  Whether it’s playing cards, shooting pool or just sharing stories, friendships are built and hope is transferred at The Outlet. And through the relationships established there, the homeless are then encouraged to enter into long-term recovery programs.
</div></div>
</div>

<div class="selector">
  <p>You can highlight a block of content by applying the <code>.lead</code> selector to the containing parent element. </p>
  <div class="crds-example">
<p class="lead">Build relationships with the homeless in our city by hanging out at The Outlet at City Gospel Mission, a place where they can recharge and connect with people who care about them by providing positive interpersonal relationships. Whether it’s playing cards, shooting pool or just sharing stories, friendships are built and hope is transferred at The Outlet. And through the relationships established there, the homeless are then encouraged to enter into long-term recovery programs.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="selector">
  <p>Use the <code>.quiet</code> selector when you want to decrease the prominence of a certain block of copy.</p>
  <div class="crds-example">
<p class="quiet">Build relationships with the homeless in our city by hanging out at The Outlet at City Gospel Mission, a place where they can recharge and connect with people who care about them by providing positive interpersonal relationships.
