  <li>Receive one-on-one prayer after the weekend service. Simply stay in your seat after the service is over, and a member of our Prayer Team will ask to pray with you.</li>
  <li>Schedule a listening appointment. During this hour long session, a member of our Pastoral Care team will listen to you and provide a safe place to process whatever you’re going through. If you’d like them to, they are also able to pray for you during that session. </li>
  <li>Join the Prayer Team. If you have a heart for prayer, are actively following Jesus and have served somewhere at Crossroads for at least six months, we’d love to talk to you about joining the Prayer Team. </li>
  <li>Learn more about prayer. Prayer is more than just putting the right words together. It’s about having a relationship with God.   </li>
